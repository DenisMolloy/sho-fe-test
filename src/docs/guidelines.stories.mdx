## Responsive web design

Components are built by following the **mobile-first approach**.

We have the following thresholds in place:

1. Minimal supported width is **320px**. If a resolution is less than this threshold the horizontal scroll bar may appear.
2. Maximum supported width is **1440px**. If a resolution is greater than this threshold content will stop expanding while being centered.

Chakra's default breakpoints are used to achieve great results for all resolutions:

1. 480px
2. 768px
3. 992px
4. 1280px
5. 1536px

## Accessibility

We aim to conform to [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) Level AA.

Components are built following the [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) strategy and in compliance with [WAI-ARIA recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/).

We use semantic HTML as the foundation of web accessibility.

We follow [WAI Accessibility Principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-principles/) and [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/).
